# Linear Inverse Model

Some description

## 1. Introduction

The time evolution of a climate state $\mathbf{x}$ may often be approximated by the stochastically forced linear dynamical system,

$$
\frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{x}}{\mathrm{d}t} = \mathbf{Lx} + \mathbf{\xi}
$$

where $\mathbf{x}(t)$ is the climate state, $\mathbf{L}$ is a linear dynamical operator, $\mathbf{\xi}$ is a vector of temporally white noise that may have spatial structure, and $t$ is time. Determining the system from covariances of climate variables results in a Linear Inverse Model (LIM; Penland & Sardeshmukh 1995).
